      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="lede">
        I’m Mick—a sales guy, not an engineer. In May 2025 I discovered research on 40&nbsp;Hz “gamma” stimulation,
        connected it to my mom’s story, and set out to build a simple, low‑cost, no‑ads app that could help millions.
        Thanks to AI, I could turn an idea into reality.
      </p>

    <section class="story">
      <h3>The spark</h3>
      <p>
        My mom was one of the sharpest people I’ve ever known. She graduated from Tsinghua University as an engineer,
        built a successful global manufacturing business, and lived with incredible clarity and determination.
        In her final months, she didn’t recognize her own family. That loss changed me.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I read about 40&nbsp;Hz light and sound in May 2025, it resonated. I looked around and saw purpose‑built
        machines costing thousands—and apps that were expensive, cluttered, or ad‑heavy. I wanted a different path:
        a gentle app that’s simple, ad‑free, and extremely affordable.

      <h3>Built entirely with AI, start to finish</h3>
      <p>
        Two years earlier, I wouldn’t have stood a chance. I had zero development experience. But with today’s AI,
        I moved from idea to prototype, then iterated through testing, refinement, and even this website and marketing copy—guided by AI.

      <ul class="about-list">
        <li><strong>Ideation:</strong> scope, safety language, and simple UX.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> generating Swift code, debugging, and tuning the 40&nbsp;Hz experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Refinement:</strong> accessibility, background audio, timers, colors, device handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Website &amp; content:</strong> structure, copy, assets, SEO basics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No investors, no team—just persistence, AI assistance, and a mission that mattered.</p>
