        LucidWave is a simple app for 40 Hz light &amp; sound sessions—created in honor of my mom,
        who was the sharpest person I knew. Toward the end, she didn’t recognize her own family.
        The brain is a mystery, but there is hope. This is my small way to help—yours, too.

      <h2>Made with love, for someone I love</h2>
      <p>
        After reading promising research on 40 Hz stimulation, I kept thinking about my mom. She was
        brilliant—funny, sharp, unstoppable. Watching memory fade was heartbreaking. I wanted to do
        something—learn something new, build something useful, and share it widely.
      </p>
      <p>
        LucidWave is my personal project turned public invitation: try a gentle practice, share it
        with someone you care about, and contribute to the science. 100% of profits from the small
        subscription fee go to brain research.

        • If you have a history of photosensitive epilepsy or similar conditions, consult a clinician before using light flicker.<br/>
        • Start gently: lower brightness, shorter sessions, comfortable color.<br/>
        • Stop if you feel discomfort, eye strain, dizziness, or headache.<br/>
        • Use in a safe setting—seated or lying down if that’s more comfortable.
