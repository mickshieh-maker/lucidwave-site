        Emerging research suggests that gamma-frequency (around 40&nbsp;Hz) light and sound stimulation
        may support aspects of brain health. Weâ€™re encouraged by the growing body of workâ€”from MIT and other labsâ€”and
        want to make exploration accessible to everyone.

        her own family. That loss changed me. LucidWave is my way of honoring her and helping others.

      <h2 id="practice-title">How to practice it</h2>
      <p>
        Research protocols often use about <strong>60 minutes daily</strong> of 40&nbsp;Hz stimulation. You can ease in and
        build a routine that fits your life:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sound-only in the background:</strong> Start with 40&nbsp;Hz audio while you do other tasks. LucidWave supports background audio so you can keep using your phone.</p>
      <p><strong>Light + sound at night:</strong> Before bedtime, with lights off, place your phone face-up. The indirect flicker can be present without staring directly at the screen.</p>
      <p class="muted">LucidWave is for wellness and self-care. It isnâ€™t a medical device and doesnâ€™t diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease. If you have a history of photosensitive epilepsy or similar conditions, consult a clinician before using flicker.</p>

    <section class="story" id="story" aria-labelledby="story-title">
      <h2 id="story-title">For My Mom, and for Millions More</h2>
      <p>
        My mom was one of the sharpest people Iâ€™ve ever known. She graduated as an engineer from
        Tsinghua University, the top university in China, at a time when very few women pursued engineering.
        From there, she went on to build a highly successful manufacturing company with a global presenceâ€”
        leading teams, traveling the world, and solving complex problems with the sharp mind that defined her.
      </p>
      <p>
        But toward the end of her life, everything changed. The same woman who once could outthink anyone in
        the room began to slip away. Her days became clouded with confusion, and in her final months, she
        didnâ€™t recognize anyoneâ€”including her own family. Watching someone go from a life of brilliance and
        accomplishment to struggling through mostly bad days was heartbreaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        That experience stayed with me. Iâ€™m not an engineer, and before LucidWave, I had no app-building
        experience. But I knew I had to do something. Inspired by promising research on 40&nbsp;Hz light and
        sound stimulation, I challenged myself to create LucidWaveâ€”not just as a personal tribute to my mom,
        but as a way to give others hope and a tool that might help. This app is more than technologyâ€”itâ€™s
        love, memory, and determination translated into action. And because this is about something bigger
        than me, <strong>100% of profits from subscriptions go directly to brain research and supporting brain care.</strong>
        My hope is that LucidWave can help millions of people and families who shouldnâ€™t have to go through
        the same pain unnecessarily.

      <h2 id="faq-title">FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Is LucidWave a medical treatment?</h3>
      <p>No. It is a wellness and self-care app. It does not diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to stare at the screen?</h3>
      <p>No. Many users prefer indirect light or sound-only mode. Benefits may still be possible without direct staring.</p>

      <h3>Why a subscription if you donate all profits?</h3>
      <p>Subscriptions cover hosting and app development costs. Everything beyond that goes to brain research and care.</p>

      <h3>When will the app be on the App Store?</h3>
      <p>Soon. The iOS app is in preparation for release. Updates will be posted here.</p>

      <h3>Does it work on Android?</h3>
      <p>Currently iOS only. Android may be considered in the future.</p>

      <h3>How long should I practice daily?</h3>
      <p>Research often uses ~60 minutes/day. Start small and build up as it fits your schedule.</p>

      <h3>Is it safe for everyone?</h3>
      <p>Not recommended if you have photosensitive epilepsy or light sensitivity. Reduce brightness, shorten sessions, and stop if uncomfortable.</p>
